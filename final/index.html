    <h1>The Bangladesh Poverty Crisis</h1>
    <p><b>The map below highlights the percentage of Bangladeshi people living below the poverty line, which is globally recognized as $1.90 per day. Utilizing the popups located at various zilas throughout Bangladesh, you can compare the percentage of impoverished Bangladeshis living within that zila to the national average, which is at 32.3%. For clarification, the percentage value is calculated by dividing the population of Bangladeshis living on $1.90 per day or less by the total zila population. <br><br>The income level of those living in Bangladesh is vital to examine, as there have been increasing occurrences of transnational corporations being exposed for exploiting Bangladeshi workers. One of the most notable incidents occurred in April 2013, when a major garment factory in Dhaka collapsed, killing over 1,100 workers. Since this detrimental event, many around the world have gathered in order to take a stand against unethical labor practices. Garment workers are entilted, at the very least, a wage that allows for them to cover basic necessities, as well as sturdy, structurally sound buildings, the right to unionize without fear, and the freedom to send their children to receive an education. Children as young as 12 years old are also sent to work 15 hour work days alongside their parents in order to help cover the costs of basic living.<br><br>The exploitation of Bangladeashi workers must cease. Ethical labor practices must be implemented in order to prevent further disasters from occurring. No workers' lives should be threatened by going to work. </b></p>
